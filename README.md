# rust-http-server
>yet another http crate

## Preamble

This isn't really a crate for you to use. You should consider [hyper] for that. This is me trying to learn Rust and how to do OSS. See the [lack of dependencies](https://github.com/vortami/rust-http-server/blob/main/Cargo.lock)?

I'm not even sure if I should make this repo public, but I do need more OSS contributions (even if it's on my own project).

## Documentation
I have documented nearly everything in the crate, also as part of me learning OSS.
```
cargo doc
```

## Contributing
No. Again, this is just me trying to learn Rust.

## License
No. I am not licensing this code for use. Actually, if you do use some of this code: why? Use a crate that's meant to be used, like [hyper].
